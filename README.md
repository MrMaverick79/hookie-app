# HOOKIE Bookmarks

Welcome to **HOOKIE Bookmarks** README.

==HOOKIE== is a simple to use platform for storing bookmarks in categories-or hooks--in a way that makes them easy to find and access them.



**Features**:

:file_folder: Easy to use collections to store, edit, and access your links.
:bookmark_tabs: Tag your links and view similar links in any category
:speech_baloon: Notes for both Hooks and Links so you know why you stored them in the first place.
:bookmark: View all links in alphabetical order
